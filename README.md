# Ellipsoid method for convex stochastic optimization in small dimension

## Introduction

This is the implementation of the experiments, which were done for the article ["Ellipsoid method for convex stochastic optimization in small dimension"](link_hear). 
Our ellipsoid method realisation extends [torch.optimizer.Optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/optim/optimizer.html#Optimizer), consequently it can be used for neural network trainings.
